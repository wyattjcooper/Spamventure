Text based adventure written in Prolog 

CS60 Spring 2015 Assignment

Win the game by discovering who killed the captain (actually there is much more to it than that but that would be spoilers)
you have amnesia, so there is chance you might forget where you are and wind up in a mystery location!
other features: use of a maybe (random probability) to determine when you get lost
note that I commented this feature out because its actually really annoying.  The code is still there to see how it works
items can be used, and their ability to be used depends on location
items can be dropped dyanmic environment description based on whether or not you have visited the location and what you have done there 
 (i.e used items)
